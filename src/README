Testing/development
===================

To run epumgmt tests, run:

$ ./src/run-tests.sh

If you want more fine grained control, you can change to the src/python directory
and run something like:

$ nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=epumgmt.main.em_core_status

During (test driven) development this can be conveniently combined with:

$ ./sbin/cat-latest-logfile.sh

... in order to view the log output from the last-run test.
