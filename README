Testing/development
===================

To run epumgmt tests, run:

$ nosetests epumgmt

If you want more fine grained control, you can run something like:

$ nosetests epumgmt --with-coverage --cover-package=epumgmt.main.em_core_status

You may also want to avoid slow tests, to do this, use:

$ nosetests epumgmt -a '!slow'
